## Abstract
1.	To understand metapopulation declines we generally look for changes in demographic rates within a single or limited set of sub-populations and presume that they are representative. With this information, we often then ascribe blanket conservation measures for the whole metapopulation to reverse declines by targeting the proximate mechanism(s) for overall population change. However, such approaches may not be appropriate in circumstances where sub-populations are spatiotemporally segregated for portions of the annual cycle as they are exposed to different environmental changes and therefore can have different demographics. 
2.	The Greenland White-fronted Goose Anser ablifrons flavirostris is an arctic migrant that largely comprises two sub-populations. The overall metapopulation has declined since 1999 but this trend is only mirrored in one sub-population and the causes of this disparity remain unclear. Here we compare demographic rates of two sub-populations, focussing on the drivers and trends in productivity at the population- and individual-level and how the two sub-populations contribute to metapopulation demographics. 
3.	We examined how broad-scale temperature and precipitation influenced population-level reproductive success derived from range wide juvenile censuses and whether there was a change in regulation when the metapopulation began to decline. In addition we used biologging devices to reconstruct incubation events and modelled how individual-level life history and environmental conditions influenced nest survival. Together these approaches provide complementary inferences on the drivers of reproductive success. 
4.	Regulation of reproductive success in both sub-populations has shifted away from temperature and precipitation on the breeding grounds. Resulting in a decline in reproductive success for the more northerly breeding sub-population. At the individual-level this appears to be due to high rates of nest failure during incubation. In the more southerly breeding sub-population there has been no decline in breeding success yet the sub-population has decreased suggesting another demographic parameter may be important, e.g. survival and/or emigration. 
5.	Our findings have important implications for conservation practitioners as bespoke conservation strategies, targeting different regulating factors, would be required to reverse declines in each sub-populations.
