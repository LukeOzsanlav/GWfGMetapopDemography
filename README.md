## Data Availability

Please note that the tracking data set used in the individual-level analysis has not been made available. However, the outputs of each script have been included so our analysis should be able to be mostly re-created. This means that scripts 1-4 will not run fully by downloading the repository. The population-level analysis should be able to be run in full. For this the environmental data has been provided but the specific locations of nest sites removed.


## Manuscript Status

MS will be submitted to *Journal of Animal Ecology*

## Abstract

1.	To understand metapopulation declines we generally look for changes in demographic rates within a single or few sub-populations and presume they are widely representative. With this information, we often ascribe blanket conservation measures across metapopulations to reverse declines by targeting the proximate mechanism(s) for overall population change. However, such approaches may not be appropriate in circumstances where sub-populations are spatiotemporally segregated during the annual cycle and exposed to different environmental changes. 
2.	The Greenland White-fronted Goose *Anser albifrons flavirostris* is an Arctic migrant that largely comprises two sub-populations. The metapopulation has declined since 1999 but this trend is only mirrored in one sub-population and the causes of this disparity are unclear. Here we compare demographic rates of the two sub-populations, focussing on the drivers and trends in productivity at the population- and individual-level. 
3.	We examined how broad-scale temperature and precipitation influenced sub-population-level reproductive success and whether there was a change in limitation when the metapopulation began to decline. In addition we used biologging devices to reconstruct incubation events and modelled how phenology and environmental conditions influenced nest survival at the individual-level. 
4.	Reproductive success at the population-level has shifted away from limitation by broad-scale temperature and precipitation on the breeding grounds for both sub-populations. This has resulted in declining reproductive success for the more northerly, but not the southerly breeding sub-population, which at the individual-level appears to be due to differences in nest failure rates. Nest survival of the northerly breeding sub-population increased with earlier breeding grounds arrival and less precipitation during incubation, no factors were important for the other sub-population. This suggests the two sub-populations are now limited by different factors and that another demographic parameter (e.g. survival and/or emigration) may be important for the southerly breeding sub-population
5.	Our findings have important implications for demographic modelling as derived demographic rates may not be widely applicable across sub-populations. This is important for conservation practitioners to consider as bespoke conservation strategies, targeting different limiting factors, may be required to reverse declines in each sub-population.
